<h1>Summary</h1>

<div class="text">
	I received my Bachelors (Electrical Engineering) and Masters (Embedded Systems) from Eindhoven University of Technology. In April 2014, I successfully defended my PhD thesis at the same university. During the PhD I gained experience through two internships: with the OpenCL compiler group of ARM in Cambridge (UK), and with the cuFFT team of NVIDIA in Santa Clara (CA). After that, I worked as a GPU consultant at the SURFsara supercomputing center and as a C++ performance engineer for a computer vision and machine learning team at Blippar. Following, I worked at TomTom on deep learning software for autonomous driving in Python for 4.5 years. Currently, I work as deep learning engineer at Plumerai, creating the <a href=https://blog.plumerai.com/2022/11/mlperf-tiny-1.0/>world's fastest neural network inference engine for edge devices</a>.

<h1>Interests and expertise</h1>

<div class="text">
	My main programming languages are modern C++, Python, and CUDA/OpenCL for GPU programming. For several years I have worked on machine learning for computer vision applications, mainly in Python and TensorFlow. This includes both the software engineering as well as the machine learning research aspects. I also have experience with compilers, high-performance computing, computer architecture, code-optimization, micro-controllers, and low-level programming.
	<br/><br/>
	As a hobby I program in C, Python, modern C++, and OpenCL. The largest hobby project is <a href=https://github.com/CNugteren/CLBlast>CLBlast</a>, an OpenCL BLAS library. CLBlast is used as a backend in one of the main open-source large-language-model frameworks <a href=https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp>llamacpp</a>. For more hobby projects, see <a href=projects.html>the projects page</a>. Other than that, I like to run, watch & read Sci-Fi, and spend time with my kids.
