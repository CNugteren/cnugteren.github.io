<h1>CLBlast: The tuned OpenCL BLAS library</h1>

<div class="text">
	CLBlast is a modern, lightweight, performant and tunable OpenCL BLAS library written in C++11. It is designed to leverage the full performance potential of a wide variety of OpenCL devices from different vendors, including desktop and laptop GPUs, embedded GPUs, and other accelerators. CLBlast implements BLAS routines: basic linear algebra subprograms operating on vectors and matrices.
	<br/><br/>
	The library is not tuned for all possible OpenCL devices: if out-of-the-box performance is poor, please run the tuners first. See <a href=https://github.com/CNugteren/CLBlast#using-the-tuners-optional>the README on GitHub</a> for a list of already tuned devices and instructions on how to tune yourself and contribute to future releases of the CLBlast library.

<h2>Why CLBlast and not clBLAS or cuBLAS?</h2>

<div class="text">
	Use CLBlast instead of clBLAS:<br><br>
	<ol>
		<li>When you care about achieving maximum performance.</li>
		<li>When you want to be able to inspect the BLAS kernels or easily customize them to your needs.</li>
		<li>When you run on exotic OpenCL devices for which you need to tune yourself.</li>
		<li>When you are still running on OpenCL 1.1 hardware.</li>
		<li>When you prefer a C++ API over a C API (C API also available in CLBlast).</li>
		<li>When you value an organized and modern C++ codebase.</li>
		<li>When you target Intel CPUs and GPUs or embedded devices.</li>
		<li>When you can benefit from the increased performance of half-precision fp16 data-types.</li>
	</ol>
    <br>
	Use CLBlast instead of cuBLAS:<br><br>
	<ol>
		<li>When you want your code to run on devices other than NVIDIA CUDA-enabled GPUs.</li>
		<li>When you want to tune for a specific configuration (e.g. rectangular matrix-sizes).</li>
		<li>When you sleep better if you know that the library you use is open-source.</li>
		<li>When you are using OpenCL rather than CUDA.</li>
	</ol>
    <br>
	When not to use CLBlast:<br><br>
	<ol>
		<li>When you run on NVIDIA's CUDA-enabled GPUs only and can benefit from cuBLAS's assembly-level tuned kernels.</li>
	</ol>
